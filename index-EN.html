            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 16-year-old young man, still searching for myself and trying to discover what I truly love.
                I don't have a final answer about my interests yet, but I like to try new things and learn by doing.
                Currently, I am interested in programming and trying to learn it to see if it suits me.
                I like to be an understanding person, always developing myself, respecting others, and valuing calmness and deep thinking.
                I don't like to waste my time and try to invest it in things that benefit me in the long run.
                I believe that experience is the best way to understand, and that everyone has their own way to reach their goals.
                I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but I intend to continue and learn until I reach my goals.

            <h2>My Abilities</h2>
            <p>
                My abilities are currently simple, but they are growing with time and experience.
                I learn quickly when I do things myself, and I understand things better when I see them in practice.
                I can focus if I'm interested in something, and I like to notice details.
                I can commit if I am convinced by a certain goal, and I have patience if I see that something is worth it.
                I use my laptop well, and I am learning programming step by step.
                I like organization and planning, even if sometimes I get lazy with execution.
                Maybe I haven't fully discovered my true ability yet, but I'm ready to try and learn until I know exactly where I excel.

            <h2>My Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                My achievements may not be many, but I consider every step of learning an achievement.
                I managed to start learning programming on my own and tried new things I didn't know about before.
                I dedicated time every week for experimentation and development, and that alone is a strong step.
                I became more confident using computers and programs, and I started to understand some basics of technology.
                I learned how to search, how to learn from my mistakes, and how to make the most of my time.
                Most importantly, I have the will to continue, and I started walking my path instead of waiting for someone to guide me.
                And maybe my greatest achievement so far: I haven't given up, and I'm still searching for myself.
